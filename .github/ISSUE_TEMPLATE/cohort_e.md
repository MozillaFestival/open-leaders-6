If you're a group, each teammate should complete this assessment individually. This is here to help you set your own personal goals during the program.

- [ ] Watch ['Mozilla & Working Open'](https://youtu.be/quKdaqlR_9w).

- [ ] Use your canvas to [start writing a README](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/), or landing page, for your project. Link to your README in a comment on this issue.
