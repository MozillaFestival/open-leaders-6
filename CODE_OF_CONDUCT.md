# Participation Guidelines

Mozilla Open Leaders respects Mozilla's [community participation guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). These guidelines cover our behaviour as participants, mentors, experts, staff, volunteers, and anyone else involved in making Mozilla Open Leaders possible.

## How to treat each other

Be respectful and value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints.
Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.
Be inclusive and help new perspectives be heard.
Appreciate and accommodate our many cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs.
Be open to learning from others.
Lead by example and match your actions with your words.

## Inclusion and Diversity

The Mozilla Project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.

Mozilla-based activities should be inclusive and should support such diversity.

## Raising Issues

If you believe you‘re experiencing practices which don‘t meet the above policies, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact the Mozilla Open Leaders organizers, Abigail Cabunoc Mayes or Chad Sansing.

Mozilla Open Leaders  organisers reserve the right to refuse admission to anyone violating these policies, and/or take further action including expulsion from the program.
