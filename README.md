## Hello and Welcome to our project. 
We are members of the Virtually Connecting community. We are excited to share our work with you and welcome your contributions.
The purpose of Virtually Connecting is to enliven virtual participation in academic conferences, widening access to a fuller conference experience for those who cannot be physically present at conferences. We are a community of volunteers and it is always free to participate.
Using emerging technologies, we connect onsite conference presenters and attendees with virtual participants in small groups. This allows virtual conference participants to meet and talk with conference presenters and attendees in what often feels like those great spontaneous hallway conversations, something not usually possible for a virtual experience. There is only room for 10 in each session but we record and, whenever possible, live stream, to allow additional virtual attendees to participate in the discussion by listening and asking questions via Twitter.

## Our Vision
The Mozilla Open Leaders Round 6 team of Helen DeWaard, Nate Angell, Rebecca Hogue, and Wendy Taleo are examining existing Virtually Connecting community, practices and tools to capture, maintain and create ways that support our existing and growing community. We want to better understand the characteristics, interactions, sequences, and hospitalities that support others in global campfire conversation spaces.

We work openly because we want to welcome the voices of anyone interested in participating in the community and maintain the Virtually Connecting open ethos. We are #WOLO supporters.

Our project is special because we welcome diverse voices into conversations with a unique version of what we call “radical hospitality”. During Mozilla Open Leaders Round 6 (Sep–Dec 2018), we are focused on three primary projects:

1. Defining “Radical Hospitality” as it applies to Virtually Connecting work. Tagged as #VCRadHosp
2. Creating a place and sustainable maintenance process for a set of standard documentation and templates for Virtually Connecting. Tagged as #VCDocumentation and/or #VCTemplates
3. Collecting a current list of Virtually Connecting members and their roles/abilities. Tagged as #VCMembership
